Assuptions:
	About the UseArgument class in Task 13, I assume we need to output one line only after one execution, 
	so I decide to change the argument every time before executing. The first one is Alice, second one is Bob, 
	the third one is Zoe (myname). If we are supposed to print three lines one time, a for loop can be added, 
	and add three arguments together.
